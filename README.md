# Globus Map

This project shall display a map of germany, stripped down to community level,
where the next globus supermarket is. This is due to the fact that i really
love Leberkaesebroetchen for 1 Euro from globus and I wanted to know how far
the next one is based on where people are living

## Limitations:

* Not every globus has a Leberkaesebroetchen for 1 Euro, but it is not easy
  to find out which one have and which not. Therefore, it shows
  all globus (which is an overapproximation)
